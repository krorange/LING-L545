# Nonhuman Agency in Contemporary Ecofiction

Nonhuman, any entity that possesses human characteristics to some degree, but not enough to be considered a human, has been widely studied in the humanities and social sciences. In environmental-oriented works of fiction, namely ecofiction, nonhuman entities display agency. Many literary studies have observed nonhuman agency in environmental fiction through qualitative approaches. However, nonhuman agency in fictional settings has not been quantitatively analyzed. Through a mixed method of distant reading and close reading, this study aims at identifying nonhuman agency in contemporary ecofiction. This study will contribute to digital humanities and environmental humanities scholarship.
