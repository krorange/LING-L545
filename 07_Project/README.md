# Nonhuman Agency in Contemporary Ecofiction

Nonhuman, any entity that possesses human characteristics to some degree, but not enough to be considered a human, has been widely studied in the humanities and social sciences. In environmental-oriented works of fiction, namely ecofiction, nonhuman entities display agency. Many literary studies have observed nonhuman agency in environmental fiction through a qualitative method, namely close reading. However, there is a lack of quantitative approaches, such as distant reading, to nonhuman agency in fictional settings. Through a mixed method of distant reading and close reading, this study aims at identifying nonhuman agency in contemporary ecofiction. This study will contribute to both digital humanities and environmental humanities scholarship.
